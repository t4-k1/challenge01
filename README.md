# challenge01

## Description

This project is a refactoring challenge. I was given starter code to modify and improve. It is a showcase of both what I have learned and how I am able to use all of my available resources to complete the task.

This challenge allowed me to spend more time with documentation for both HTML and CSS, as well as finding new resources to utilize, which could become invaluable tools.
